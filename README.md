# Java

This is an inventory management application I made for my Java class.

It was my second time coding an application!

I am still a student and this was one of my first coding projects ever, so I am open to any advice and expertise you can offer.

I am currently working on a much more complicated scheduling application in Java that pulls from a SQL databse, so expect to see that here soon!

Disclaimer - I am trying to post my completed projects for the sole purpose of adding them to my portfolio website.

Thank you for your time :)
